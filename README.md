# Game of Life (Patterns) 

This project is based on [Allen Holub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Holub)'s [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation presented in his book "[Holub on Patterns](https://g.co/kgs/BMJcPP)" and on [his website](https://www.holub.com/software/life/index.html).

It is not just a copy. After reading his book and the source code I'm attempting to follow the book to reimplement the program as closely as I can while using Java 15 (instead of 1.8) and JavaFX (rather than Swing). I am doing this to better understand Java, JavaFX and OOD patterns.
